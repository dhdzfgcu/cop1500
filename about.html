    <h1> The background I chose, a picture with many different colors, proved to be unsuitable for most colors of text, since it would be hard to see. Knowing this, I added a background to the text (Credit to leftcoast (https://answers.squarespace.com/questions/112935/how-to-create-a-box-behind-text.html)) so that it would be more readable. Alt text has also been added to many pictures and videos on the various pages. </h1>
