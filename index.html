      <p>About me</p>
      <br/>
      <a href='https://postimg.cc/wRshN0jt' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/wRshN0jt/IMG_3872.jpg' border='0' alt='My sister and I (also the bottom half of my mom) at Disney'/></a>
      <p>I was born in the year 2001 to two pretty amazing parents, and a sister that once kicked me off of a ladder. Right now I'm 17 years old, and a senior in high school, as well as a sophomore in college here at FGCU. How does that work you may ask?</p>
   <p> Well that is because of the Accelerated Collegiate Experience program! More information can be found <a href="https://www.fgcu.edu/admissionsandaid/ace/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
